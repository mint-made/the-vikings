## The Vikings - A turn-based JavaScript board game
### Project Overview
This project, completed in late 2018 is a Vikings themed turn-based board game in which players can move up to 3 squares north, east, south or west to collect new weapons. When a player comes within one adjacent square of their opponent, a fight is initiated and the two players will fight to the death taking turns to attack or defend against their opponent. The warrior left standing is crowned victorious. The board game and the logic behind the game was written with JavaScript alone, with jQuery used for page transitions and Bootstrap used as a CSS libary for the project.

### Technologies Utilized
